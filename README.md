# âœ… [Completed] dapp development tutorial

This tutorial is created based on Alchemy's [Hello World Part 4 Tutorial](https://app.gitbook.com/@alchemyapi/s/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/creating-a-full-stack-dapp).

This project contains the COMPLETED files for dapp development tutorial, in which we teach you how to create a full stack dApp by connecting your TinTin Token smart contract to a React frontend using Metamask and Web3 tools.

# ðŸªœ Installation

To use this dApp, you'll need to do the following:

1. Run `npm install` to download the `node_modules` folder.
2. Download the [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) in your project directory by running `npm install dotenv --save` in your terminal
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and then add your [Alchemy API Key](https://docs.alchemy.com/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/creating-a-full-stack-dapp#establish-an-api-connection-to-the-ethereum-chain). After that, your `.env` file should just look like so:

```
REACT_APP_ALCHEMY_KEY = https://eth-goerli.g.alchemy.com/v2/<key>
```

4. Run `npm start`in your terminal to open the dApp in your browswer at http://localhost:3000/.
